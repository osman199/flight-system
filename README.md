## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to make an metasearch engine for airplane tickets online. The final product should allow users to find and buy tickets, and also write reviews for the service. Moderators on the other hand will be able to schedule flights.

### Pages

* Home Page: The user should see a sign in button as well as a "from" - "to" text boxes that allows the user to search for flights. They should also be able to read written reviews by existing users.
* Loggedin User: Logged in users should be able to also purchase tickets for an existing flight, which will prompt them to a purchasing window. They should also be able to see purchased tickets, and write reviews for the company's service. The login button should now be replaced with a log out button.
* Loggedin Moderator: Logged in moderators should recieve more detailed results of the flight including flight ID, as well as buttons that will allow them to add, change and remove flights.
